# Dog API

## Where the idea came from

I adore man's best friend. I didn't want to stray too far from the Cat API we had used, but as a dog person, I had to use the dog API. I have a dog of my own, a hound mix that is a rescue, and is as much of a bother as a cutie, but still I love her and dedicate most of my time and money to her. So, this one is for Harper the Hound.

## Tech

My Dog API uses a number of open source projects in order to work properly:

- The Dog API (https://www.thedogapi.com/)
- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript (AKA the bane of my existence)

And of course this is in a public repository on GitHub.
